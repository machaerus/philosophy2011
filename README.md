# Wittgensteinian Bomberman

This is a simple little game, inspired by classic old-style Bomberman and the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein. It was created for a semester project as an exercise in Processing.

So far there's only one level which isn't actually fascinating anyway, but is more or less playable (you can win and you can lose). I may consider developing it further if you are willing to donate. Otherwise, take it as it is and have fun.
